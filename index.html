        <h1>Bill Gates Bio</h1>
        <p>Bill Gates full name is William Henry Gates and was born on October 28, 1955 in Seattle, Washington.</p>
        <p>He grew up in a middle class family with two sisters named Kristianne and Libby. As a child he spent many hours reading books and educating himself; because of this his parents grew worried that he would become a bit of a loner. So they enrolled him in preparatory Lakeside School. While he was there he ended up learning about computers and ultimately started to devote his free time to learning how the computer worked.</p>
