        <h1>Bill Gates Bio</h1>
        <p>Bill Gates full name is William Henry Gates and was born on October 28, 1955 in Seattle, Washington.</p>
        <p>He grew up in a middle class family with two sisters named Kristianne and Libby. As a child he spent many hours reading books and educating himself; because of this his parents grew worried that he would become a bit of a loner. So they enrolled him in a preparatory called Lakeside School. While he was there he ended up learning about computers and ultimately started to devote his free time to learning how the computer worked.</p>
        <p> Bill excelled at school and graduated from Lakeside in 1973 and even scored a 1590 out of a 1600 on his college SAT test. Later he enrolled in Harvard and persued a law degree. There he met Paul Allen another fellow computer enthusiast  which he then dropped out from to persue his business, Microsoft. </p>
